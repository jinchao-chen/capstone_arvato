## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
This is part of the Capstone Project for the Udacity Data Scientist nano degree program. 

In this project, the demographics data was utilized, to identify the potential customers for the mail-order company, a client of Arvato Financial Services. A supervised machine learning model, the outcome of this project, aims to facilitate acquiring new customers more efficiently.

## Description<a name="descriptions"></a>
The project is composed of three parts:

- Part I: Feature Summary: Understanding the data and data cleaning
- Part II: Segmentaion Report: a customer segmentation report (unsupervised learning)
- Part III: Ensembling Classifiers: a classifier that targets the potential new client group

In the first part, the main focus is on cleaning the data and exploring feature engineering options. The data is then used to build an unsupervised machine learning model that performs customer segmentation and identifies features that best describe the customer. Lastly, a prediction model was created to identify individuals who are more likely to become a client in the campaign.
